# Changelog

All notable changes to the **RoozyLabs Prism** project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **SemVer (Semantic Versioning 2.0.0) Baseline & Pre-Release Standard**: Formalized monorepo versioning baseline at `v0.1.0` (Foundation Pre-Release).
- **Multi-Layer Feature Flag Engine (`internal/featureflags` & `lib/features`)**:
  - Environment variable overrides (`FEATURE_FLAG_*`) with Plan Tier entitlement matrix (`free`, `pro`, `team`, `enterprise`).
  - Endpoint `GET /api/v1/features` exposing active capabilities to clients and dashboard.
  - React hook `useFeatureFlags()` and declarative `<FeatureGate />` component.
  - 12 core capability flags: `smart_router_auto`, `playground_multimodal`, `mcp_gateway`, `resource_gateway`, `governance_guardrails`, `turnstile_protection`, `realtime_anomaly_stream`, `finops_budget_alerts`, `paperclip_orchestrator`, `merkle_audit_verification`, `custom_role_builder`, `vault_kms_byok`.
- **System & Provider Managed Model Catalog & Benchmark Browser**: Dynamic model browsing, filtering by provider, latency/quality scores, and token pricing without manual insertion friction.
- **Strict Multi-Tenant Isolation for Resource Gateway**: Scoped all DB queries and REST/GraphQL context backends with `org_id` and `workspace_id`.
- **2-Column Settings Layout with Vertical Subnavigation Sidebar**: Modern settings interface with notifications email switches, in-app alerts, profile, and security controls.
- **24-Identity Multi-Role Dummy Matrix & Security Audit Suite**: Verified seeder with bcrypt credentials for all 6 RBAC roles across all 4 subscription tiers.

### Added
- **MCP Server Detail Page with Invocation Usage Tracking**: A dedicated dynamic route `/mcp/[id]` in the Next.js dashboard now visualizes per-server usage and topology:
  - **Backend invocation persistence (migration `073`)**: New `mcp_server_invocations` table records every MCP tool call (user, server, tool, status code, error flag/message, latency) with tenant RLS and `created_at` indexes.
  - **Gateway instrumentation**: `MCPGateway.ExecuteTool` now best-effort saves an invocation on every terminal path (success, transport error, upstream tool error) without breaking the tool-call response.
  - **Stats endpoint**: `GET /api/mcp/servers/:id/stats?days=` returns aggregated metrics (total/success/error requests, success rate, avg latency) plus a per-tool breakdown, clamped to a 7/30/90 sliding window.
  - **Connected agents (server-side reverse lookup)**: The stats endpoint resolves which agents reference the server via `agents.allowed_mcp_servers`, returning bindings for the detail page.
  - **Detail page sections**: request/error/latency metric cards, window selector, tool usage breakdown with progress bars, connected agents, synced tools table, and reusable Test modal / edit dialog; the MCP list cards now link to the detail page.
- **TypeScript SDK (`@roozylabs/prism` v2.2.0)**: `MCPModule.getServerStats(serverId, days?)` plus `MCPServerStats`, `MCPToolStat`, and `MCPAgentBinding` types.

### Changed
- Synchronized release version to `2.2.0` across all package manifests (`apps/app`, `apps/web`, `packages/sdk`, `packages/cli`), UI version badges (`AppLayout`, `AuthLayout`), API swagger annotation (`main.go` `@version`), health endpoint, and OpenTelemetry service version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Frontend Production Architecture & Reliability Overhaul**: Executed full 10-phase production refactor of `apps/app` and supporting API routes:
  - **100% Strict Type Safety**: Eradicated all occurrences of `: any` and `as any` (`tsc --noEmit` 0 errors).
  - **HttpOnly Cookie Authentication**: Issued secure `auth_token` cookies with `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/; Secure` on `/auth/login` and `/auth/logout`, eliminating client-side token exposure.
  - **Dynamic Multi-Tenancy**: Added backend RBAC organization query (`GET /user/organizations`) and connected `TenantSelector` to live database organizations.
  - **Modular API Architecture**: Decomposed monolithic 1,400-line `api.ts` into 20+ typed domain modules under `lib/api/`.
  - **Data Correctness**: Integrated dynamic date-range filtering in PostgreSQL stats queries and replaced synthetic token multipliers with real telemetry counts.
  - **Dedicated Mutation Hooks**: Segregated mutations under `hooks/mutations/` with cache invalidation rules.
  - **Architectural Documentation**: Published `docs/frontend-architecture-audit.md`, `docs/frontend-design-system.md`, and `docs/frontend-architecture-improvement.md`.
- **AntiSloP Install, Design Baseline & Audit**: Installed the full anti-slop skill family (core filter plus `code`, `ui`, `copywriting`, `layoutmobile`, and `human` companions) under `.agents/skills/`, authored `DESIGN.md` as the visual/UX direction for the Prism console (single Prism Violet accent, Inter + JetBrains Mono, low-energy flat surfaces), registered an every-session pointer rule in `.agents/rules/antislop.md`, and ran a full AFTER-mode audit of `apps/app` recorded in `anti-slop/audit-001-2026-08-30.md`.
- **Anti-slop copy & accessibility polish**: Replaced em dashes with colons/commas across dashboard copy and table/summary null placeholders (anti-slop R-02), and raised the violet accent used as small text from `#8B5CF6` to `#7C3AED` to reach WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast (R-25). Icon, brand, and graphical usages of the violet accent are unchanged.

### Changed
- **React Hook Form + Zod Form Refactor**: Migrated all Dashboard create/edit/test/invite forms (`mcp`, `tools`, `agents`, `governance`, `credentials`, `providers`, `resources`, `models`, `policies`, `gateway-keys`, `budgets`, `settings/*`) from scattered primitive `useState` fields to structured React Hook Form (`useForm`) with `zodResolver` validation. Each page now co-locates its form/modal components under a page-scoped `_components/` folder (e.g. `MCPServerFormDialog`, `ToolTestModal`, `AgentFormDialog`, `PolicyTuner`, `BudgetFormSheet`, `QuotaFormSheet`, `SettingFormSheet`, `InviteMemberSheet`). Form submission is wired through React Query `useMutation` hooks with typed Zod schemas, inline field validation messages, and declarative success/error workflows.

### Fixed
- **MCP Edit Modal Header Repopulation**: The MCP server edit form now fetches a fresh copy from `GET /mcp/servers/:id` instead of relying on list-card props, so previously stored headers (decrypted server-side, returned only to the edit view) load correctly. The response for that endpoint now serves only the fields the editor needs (a slim `MCPServerEdit` DTO including `headers` and `hasAuthToken`), and the auth-token field shows a hint that an existing stored token is retained when left blank. SDK `MCPModule.getServer` return type and OpenAPI spec updated to match.
- **MCP Edit Modal Compile Fix**: The MCP page previously referenced a dropped `editingId`/`setEditingId` declaration (a regression introduced during a prior merge), which broke `pnpm typecheck`. The refactor restores this state internally within `MCPServerFormDialog`, resolving the compile/lint failure.

### Added
- **Custom Tool Registry Backends & Input Schema Editor**: The `/tools` register/edit dialog now includes a JSON `inputSchema` editor (defines the function-call arguments surfaced to the AI model) and a repeatable **Execution Backends** section (`name`, `endpointUrl`, `authToken`, `timeoutMs`, `priority`). Tools created or edited from the dashboard are now actually executable end-to-end via the Test modal, and the API `Update` handler no longer wipes `inputSchema` when a request omits it (defensive nil-guard).
- **Real MCP Server Connectivity**: Upgraded the MCP gateway (`apps/api/internal/proxy/mcp_gateway.go`) from a stateless JSON-RPC POST (`sendRPC`) to a full MCP client built on `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` v0.58.0. `SyncServerTools` and `ExecuteTool` now perform the complete MCP handshake (`initialize` → `initialized` → `tools/list` / `tools/call`) with transport-awareness:
  - **Streamable HTTP** transport (default) for servers such as Context7.
  - **SSE** transport for servers such as Firecrawl.
  - Optional `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header derived from the stored encrypted auth token.
- **MCP Integration Tests**: Replaced the plain JSON-RPC mock tests with real in-process MCP servers (Streamable HTTP and SSE) verifying the full sync/execute flow.
- **Agent Tool / Resource / MCP Binding**: Agent create & edit forms can now bind `allowedTools`, `allowedResources`, and (new) `allowedMcpServers` via a reusable `MultiSelect`. Backend stores `allowed_mcp_servers` (new migration `071`), injects the bound servers into the generated system prompt, and the agent catalog cards show binding counts. Tools & resources were already stored by the backend but are now exposed in the UI.
- **Robust MCP Server Config (Remote + Local)**: MCP server registration now supports a full firecrawl/Context7-style configuration shape (`type`, `url`, `enabled`, `headers`) plus local/stdio execution (`command`, `args`, `env`):
  - **DB (`migration 072`)**: `mcp_servers` gains `config_type` (`remote`/`local`), `headers_encrypted` (AES-256-GCM encrypted header map), `command`, `args TEXT[]`, and `env JSONB`.
  - **API**: `CreateMCPServerRequest` accepts `type`, `headers`, `command`, `args`, `env`; the `authToken` shortcut is unified into a single encrypted `headers` map with backwards-compatible fallback to the legacy encrypted token.
  - **Proxy**: `newMCPClient` merges per-server headers and dispatches to `transport.NewStdio` for local servers or SSE/Streamable HTTP for remote servers.
  - **SDK (`@roozylabs/prism` v2.2.0)**: `MCPModule` gains `getServer`, `createServer`, `updateServer`, `deleteServer` plus the new remote/local fields on `MCPServer`.
  - **UI**: MCP form supports a Remote/Local type selector, conditional headers/command/args/env editors, an enable toggle, and a quick enable/disable switch on each server card.
- **Smart Routing 4xx Failover & Credential Health Reset**: The proxy engine now treats non-quota 4xx upstream errors (e.g. 400, 422, 404) as a recoverable attempt: it syncs credential health and, when running smart routing (`prism-auto`/`roozy-auto`/`auto`), fails over to the next candidate credential with exponential backoff instead of aborting immediately. On recovery (manual cooldown reset or a successful test), the credential's error count and health score are fully reset (`ResetErrorCount` sets `error_count = 0`, `health_score = 100.00`, `status = 'active'`) and `CREDENTIAL_QUOTA_UPDATED` / `CREDENTIAL_STATUS_CHANGED` events are published with health score 100. The Google adapter's `ensureSignature` now preserves a valid existing thought signature (checking both `thought_signature` and `thoughtSignature`) instead of unconditionally overwriting it. The credentials dashboard renders the quota status text inline under each credential status dot.
- **MCP Test Tool Browser**: The MCP test modal now loads the actual tools synced from any connected MCP server (e.g. Context7, Firecrawl, or any Streamable HTTP/SSE endpoint) and renders a tool selector with a Guided vs Raw JSON argument editor. Guided mode generates form fields from each tool's JSON input schema (string/number/boolean/enum/array/object with defaults and required markers), so context7/firecrawl-style servers (and all others) can be exercised without hand-authoring argument JSON. Backend exposes `GET /mcp/servers/:id/tools` and the SDK `MCPModule.getTools` reads the same catalog.
- **MCP Test Modal Required-Arg Validation & Sample Placeholders**: The MCP test modal now enforces each tool's declared required arguments (derived dynamically from the tool's `inputSchema` `required` array) before submitting in Guided mode — blank required fields are blocked with an inline red per-field error instead of being sent upstream and rejected (e.g. Context7 `query-docs` `query`/`libraryId`). String, numeric, and JSON/array required fields are validated by type. String inputs also gain sample placeholders (`schema examples` → `description` → a generic format-aware hint such as `/owner/repo` for repo/ID-style fields and a short prompt sample for query-style fields), so the guidance works generically for any MCP server without provider-specific hardcoding.

### Fixed
- **ProxyStream quota-exhaustion control flow**: Fixed an indentation/control-flow regression in the SSE streaming path where the rate/quota-limit (`429`) handling block was nested under the generic failure branch, which could misclassify quota exhaustion and incorrectly mark the credential invalid instead of entering cooldown with proper retry semantics.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Security & Tenant Isolation Hardening Pass (Task 01)**:
  - **Authoritative Organization & Header Spoofing Protection**: Enforced authoritative Gateway API Key (`OrgID`) ownership in `TenantMiddleware` (`apps/api/internal/middleware/tenant.go`), rejecting client header spoofing (`X-Prism-Org-ID`) with HTTP 403 Forbidden (`ErrCrossTenantForbidden`).
  - **Session User Organization Membership Verification**: Added `OrgMemberChecker` (`IsMember`) to `AccountRepository` and `TenantMiddleware` to validate web session users against `organization_members` before accepting `X-Prism-Org-ID` headers.
  - **IDOR Protection & Repository Tenant Scoping**: Scoped all resource lookup, update, reveal, test, and delete queries across `CredentialRepository` (`FindByID`, `Delete`) and `GatewayKeyRepository` (`Delete`) by authenticated `userID`/`org_id`, fixing IDOR vulnerabilities across credential and key handlers.
  - **PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) Migrations**: Created migration `070_enable_pg_rls_policies.up.sql` enabling RLS policies across 9 multi-tenant tables (`credentials`, `gateway_api_keys`, `mcp_servers`, `tools`, `resources`, `agents`, `governance_policies`, `ai_audit_trails`, `request_logs`).
  - **Redis Keyspace Tenant Isolation**: Scoped Redis rate limit keys using `tenant:{org_id}:` namespace prefixing in `GatewayRateLimitMiddleware` (`apps/api/internal/middleware/ratelimit.go`).
  - **RBAC & Governance DENY > ALLOW Precedence**: Enforced strict `DENY > ALLOW` rule evaluation ordering in `AgentGovernanceEngine` (`apps/api/internal/proxy/agent_governance.go`), ensuring explicit `!model`, `-model`, or `deny:model` rules override `*` wildcard ALLOW rules.
  - **Tool & Resource Gateway Execution Boundaries**: Enforced caller tenant ownership verification prior to tool and resource backend execution.
  - **Secret Exposure Audit & Redaction Utility**: Created `utils.RedactSensitive` regex sanitizer in `apps/api/internal/utils/mask.go` to automatically mask raw API keys (`gw_sk_*`, `sk-proj-*`, `sk-ant-*`, `AIzaSy*`) and Bearer tokens in error strings and logs.
  - **Security Regression Test Suite**: Created `apps/api/internal/security/tenant_security_test.go` covering header spoofing, unassigned org sessions, and secret redaction.
  - **Security Hardening Report**: Published comprehensive audit report at `docs/production-hardening-security.md`.

- **OpenTelemetry & Operational Observability Pipeline**:
  - Integrated OpenTelemetry Go SDK (`internal/telemetry/otel.go`, `tracer.go`, `metrics.go`) with OTLP HTTP exporter, TracerProvider, MeterProvider, and Prometheus metrics exporter.
  - Added Prometheus metrics endpoint (`GET /metrics`) exposing 8 core metric instruments (`prism_requests_total`, `prism_request_duration_seconds`, `prism_ttft_seconds`, `prism_token_usage_total`, `prism_cost_usd_total`, `prism_active_requests`, `prism_provider_error_429_total`, `prism_credential_health_score`).
  - Added operational observability stack under `deploy/otel/` (`docker-compose.otel.yml`, OTel Collector config, Prometheus config, Loki, Tempo, Grafana).

### Fixed
- **Google Gemini Thought Signature & Multi-Turn Tool Call Fix**:
  - Resolved Google Gemini HTTP 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error ("Function call is missing a thought_signature in functionCall parts").
  - Updated `SanitizeMessagesForGoogle` (`apps/api/internal/proxy/google.go`) to handle typed map slices (`[]map[string]interface{}`) and inject `thought_signature` across outer `part` and inner `functionCall` objects for Gemini tool calling.
- **CLI & SDK Credentials & Routing Fixes**:
  - Fixed `prism credential list` "creds is not iterable" CLI error by updating SDK `credentials.ts` to parse paginated `{ data: [...] }` backend responses.
  - Fixed `prism routing simulate` CLI display by standardizing camelCase factor scores in SDK `routing.ts` and CLI `routing.ts`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Asynchronous Request Queue & Decoupled Worker Pool Architecture**:
  - Implemented `AsyncPostProcessor` worker pool (`apps/api/internal/service/post_processor.go`) with buffered Go channels and worker goroutines to offload PostgreSQL log writes (`request_logs`), key usage increments (`gateway_api_keys`), cryptographic audit trail generation (`audit_trails`), and Redis SSE telemetry publishing off the hot HTTP response path.
  - Implemented Redis-backed `JobQueue` (`apps/api/internal/queue/job_queue.go`) with `BLPop` worker pool supporting `POST /v1/chat/completions/async` and `POST /api/sandbox/chat/completions/async` endpoints returning HTTP 202 Accepted.
  - Added Job Status polling endpoint (`GET /v1/jobs/:jobId` and `GET /api/jobs/:jobId`) returning job lifecycle status (`queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`), completion payload, and token metrics.
  - Added **Enable Async Execution (HTTP 202)** toggle switch in Developer Web Sandbox UI (`apps/app/app/(dashboard)/sandbox/page.tsx`) for testing asynchronous job queuing and polling.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Production-Ready API Error Envelope & Snake Case Standardization**:
  - Standardized JSON error response envelope across `apps/api` and `apps/app` returning `message`, `type`, `code`, `policy_id`, `policy_name`, and `request_id` in `snake_case`.
  - Implemented `utils.RespondWithError` helper in `apps/api/internal/utils/errors.go` and updated `ApiError` parser in `apps/app/lib/http/errors.ts`.
- **Behind-the-Scenes Agent System Persona Pre-Compilation**:
  - Pre-compiles Agent System Persona, Allowed Tools, and Allowed Resources 1x at creation/update time in `apps/api/internal/handlers/agent.go` and saves to `agents.system_prompt_override`.
  - Auto-injects pre-compiled System Persona in `gateway.go` when `req.Messages` lacks a `system` message.
  - Simplified Developer Sandbox UI (`apps/app/app/(dashboard)/sandbox/page.tsx`) to send pure user payloads (`messages: [{ role: "user", content: ... }]`).
- **Frontend Architecture Hardening & 16 Feature Modules**:
  - Re-organized Next.js routes into 3 lifecycle route groups: `(auth)`, `(onboarding)`, and `(dashboard)` while preserving 100% of public URLs.
  - Decoupled `lib/api.ts` God module into hardened HTTP client (`lib/http/client.ts`) and modular API client adapters.
  - Extracted 16 self-contained feature modules under `apps/app/features/` with multi-tenant-aware Query Key Factories (`providersKeys`, `credentialsKeys`, `agentsKeys`, etc.) and Zod form schemas.
  - Created `.agents/rules/atomic-commits-and-conventional-commits.md` enforcing atomic change isolation and conventional commit discipline (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).

### Fixed
- **RBAC Governance Pattern Matching Fix**:
  - Fixed pattern matching in `apps/api/internal/proxy/rbac_engine.go` so specific resource deny policies (e.g., `Deny Developer Cross-Domain Payroll Access`) skip non-matching requests (`ResourceName: ""`), allowing standard chat completions while blocking restricted database queries.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Developer Web Sandbox & Routing Simulator Audit (`/sandbox` & `/playground`)**:
  - **Responsive Select Layout Alignment**: Fixed `SelectTrigger` container width (`w-full min-w-0`) and added string truncation (`truncate block max-w-[220px]`) to `Gateway API Key Context` and `Agent Context Boundary` selects, eliminating padding misalignment on mobile and tablet screens.
  - **Routed Model Console Badge**: Extracted HTTP response model header (`X-Prism-Selected-Model`) and rendered `Routed: {model}` badge in the Execution Output Console header.
  - **Dynamic Smart Router Policies**: Integrated `usePoliciesQuery()` from `@/hooks/queries/usePoliciesQuery` to populate the Smart Router Policy select dropdown with live database policies from `/api/policies`.
  - **Pure Dry-Run Playground Simulator (`/playground`)**: Converted `/playground` into a pure dry-run simulator calling `/v1/routing/simulate`. Displays candidate rankings, top match scores, and cost/speed factor breakdowns without requiring API keys or consuming token budgets, with 1-click link to live `/sandbox`.
  - **Agent Context Boundary Header Correction**: Updated `useSandboxMutation.ts` to transmit `X-Prism-Agent-ID`, `X-Prism-Agent-Name`, and `X-Agent-Name` headers for agent system persona injection in the Go proxy backend.

- **Active Model Router Activity Sidebar Widget**:
  - Created `<ModelActivityWidget>` molecule component displaying real-time `prism-auto` model router status, active provider count, and `ONLINE` status dot.
  - Embedded the widget in `AppLayout.tsx` in the Admin Console Sidebar footer above the platform admin profile.

- **Compiler-Enforced Code Hygiene & Unused Import Policy**:
  - Enabled `"noUnusedLocals": true` and `"noUnusedParameters": true` in `apps/app/tsconfig.json` to trigger build failures (`tsc --noEmit`) on any unused import or local variable.
  - Created repository rule `.agents/rules/no-unused-imports-policy.md` banning unused imports and unnecessary default `import React from 'react'` in Next.js 13+.
  - Conducted codebase-wide audit and refactored 23 components and pages across `apps/app` to remove all unused imports, icons, components, and types.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Developer Web Sandbox UI & Architecture Overhaul (`/sandbox`)**:
  - Full React Hook Form (`useForm`) and Zod schema validation (`sandboxSchema`) integration.
  - Form fields wrapped in `@/components/molecules/Form.tsx` components (`Form`, `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage`).
  - Encapsulated sandbox HTTP POST executions in custom React Query mutation hook `useSandboxExecutionMutation` (`apps/app/hooks/mutations/useSandboxMutation.ts`).
  - Automated form control disabling (`disabled={isExecuting}`) across all selects, textareas, switches, and buttons during in-flight executions.
  - Mandatory Gateway API Key Context required field (`<FormLabel required>`) with red asterisk support and automatic sync to user's active `gw_sk_...` keys.
  - Enhanced Execution Output Console featuring Copy Result button, Prism Violet scrollbar (`.custom-scrollbar`), code block formatting (`FormattedSandboxOutput`), and per-block Copy Code actions.
  - Real-time SSE Response Streaming (`stream: true`) latency optimization documentation (< 500ms TTFT).

- **Dedicated React Query Mutation Hooks Architecture (`apps/app/hooks/mutations/`)**:
  - Centralized API mutations for credentials (`useCredentialMutations`), tools (`useToolMutations`), MCP servers (`useMCPMutations`), playground (`usePlaygroundMutations`), audit trail export (`useAuditLogMutations`), and sandbox (`useSandboxMutation`).

- **Repository Guidelines & Strict ESLint Rules (`.agents/rules/`)**:
  - **Prohibition of Loose `unknown` Types (`no-unknown-type-policy.md`)**: Enforced concrete JSON primitive types (`JsonValue`, `JsonObject`) and domain interfaces across Next.js UI.
  - **Prohibition of Empty Catch Blocks (`.eslintrc.json`)**: Configured `"no-empty": ["error", { "allowEmptyCatch": false }]` and refactored all empty catch blocks across `apps/app`.
  - **Form & Mutation Guidelines (`react-form-and-mutation-guidelines.md`)**: Mandatory RHF and React Query `useMutation` encapsulation rule.
  - **Strict Build Verification (`strict-eslint-and-build-verification.md`)**: Mandatory typecheck on `pnpm build` (`tsc --noEmit && next build`).
  - **Iconography Rules (`ui-icon-guidelines.md`)**: Enforced professional iconography and banned AI magic sparkles icons.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Organizational AI Control Plane Architecture**:
  - **Decoupled `ExecutionOrchestrator` (`internal/service/orchestrator.go`)**: Replaced thick handler logic in `GatewayHandler` with a dedicated execution pipeline managing `Admission → Proxy Execution → Tenant Context → Telemetry → Request Log → Cryptographic Audit Trail`.
  - **Unified `AdmissionController` (`internal/proxy/admission.go`)**: Pre-execution gate sequencing RBAC, Agent Governance, Tenant Quotas, and Multi-Level Budget Policies BEFORE provider requests or candidate scoring occurs. Returns deterministic decisions (`ALLOW`, `DENY`, `DOWNGRADE`, `WARN`).
  - **Authoritative Tenant Ownership & Security (`internal/middleware/tenant.go`)**: Enforced `GatewayAPIKey` as the authoritative source for Organization ownership. Client headers (`X-Prism-Org-ID`) can only narrow workspace/project scope within authorized orgs; cross-org header spoofing returns HTTP 403 Forbidden (`tenant_security_error`).
  - **Credential Health State Machine (`internal/proxy/router.go`)**: State machine (`HEALTHY`, `DEGRADED`, `COOLDOWN`, `EXHAUSTED`, `DISABLED`) prioritizing healthy credentials in `Router.selectByStrategy()`.
  - **Golden Path & Denied Golden Path Integration Test Suite (`internal/handlers/golden_path_test.go`)**: Automated tests verifying cross-tenant header rejection, zero provider calls on RBAC/Budget denial, and SDK/CLI governance consistency.
  - **System Runtime Architecture Documentation (`docs/prism_runtime_architecture.md`)**: Complete specification of canonical request lifecycles, security threat models, tenant boundaries, and feedback loops.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **Credential Intelligence Engine & Dynamic Health Scoring (Pillar 14 - Phase 3)**:
  - Dynamic 0–100 Credential Health Scoring combining request success rate (60% weight), active cooldown/rate-limit penalty (30% weight), and quota exhaustion penalty (10% weight).
  - Robust Credential State Machine with roadmap-standard states: `HEALTHY` (Score ≥ 80), `DEGRADED` (Score < 80), `COOLDOWN` (Active Redis TTL rate limit), `EXHAUSTED` (Quota depleted), and `DISABLED`.
  - Health-Aware Smart Pool Routing: `CredentialRepository` (`ListByProviderID`, `FindRoundRobin`, `FindLRU`, `FindAllActiveByProviderID`) automatically prioritizes healthiest credentials (`COALESCE(health_score, 100.00) DESC`) before degraded keys.
  - Database Migration `061_update_credential_health_and_states`: Added `health_score` NUMERIC(5,2) column (default 100.00) and expanded `status` check constraint.
  - OpenTelemetry Metric Gauge: Real-time metric export of `prism_credential_health_score` gauge labeled by `credential_id` and `provider_id`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture & SaaS Platform (Pillar 12)**:
  - 4-level enterprise tenant hierarchy (`Organization` ──► `Workspace` ──► `Project` ──► `Agents`).
  - Database Row-Level Security (RLS) & schema migrations (`055_create_organizations`, `056_create_workspaces`, `057_create_projects`, `058_add_multi_tenancy_foreign_keys`, `059_create_organization_members`, `060_seed_default_tenant`).
  - `TenantMiddleware` in Go backend extracting `X-Prism-Org-ID`, `X-Prism-Workspace-ID`, and `X-Prism-Project-ID` request headers.

### Fixed
- **Docker GHCR Runner Build Failure**: Fixed missing `/app/public` error during `COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public` by creating `apps/app/public/.gitkeep` and adding `RUN mkdir -p public` to builder stage in `apps/app/Dockerfile`.
- **Mobile Responsive Drawer Layout**: Added responsive mobile drawer navigation and code snippet overflow wrapping in `apps/web` for screens < 768px.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Resource Gateway (Pillar 8)**: Centralized data-layer abstraction supporting REST APIs, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL (Supabase) backends. Agents call generic data intents (`get_customer`) resolved to real data sources with priority-based failover, encrypted credentials, and read-only SQL enforcement. Admin CRUD UI with per-type configuration forms, gateway execution endpoint (`POST /v1/resources/:resourceName/query`), and audit logging.
- **Tool Gateway (Pillar 7)**: Provider-agnostic tool execution layer — register tools with input schemas and HTTP backends, gateway resolves and executes with automatic failover across priority-ordered backends. Admin CRUD UI, gateway execution endpoint (`POST /v1/tools/:toolName/execute`), full audit logging to `tool_invocations` table.
- **Statistical Spend Forecasting**: Weighted Moving Average (WMA) with trend analysis replaces simple velocity projection in FinOps summary. Displays trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable) with percentage change.
- **P95 Latency Scoring**: Smart Router now uses 95th percentile TTFT instead of average for speed scoring — catches tail-latency spikes that averages miss.
- **Success-Rate Telemetry Tracking**: Redis telemetry now tracks per-model success rates; models with <95% success rate (≥10 samples) are penalized in scoring.
- **Historical Latency Flush Worker**: Hourly background worker flushes Redis telemetry aggregates into `model_latency_hourly` table for persistent trend analysis.
- **Payload Retention Cleanup Worker**: Hourly cleanup of `request_payloads` and `tool_invocations` tables older than 30 days to prevent unbounded growth.
- **Budget Alert Acknowledgment API**: `POST /analytics/finops/budget-alerts/:id/acknowledge` endpoint for managing budget alerts.
- **Audit Trail — Response Hash & Bytes**: Every proxied request now records SHA-256 response hash and byte count in `request_logs` for integrity verification and audit.
- **Audit Trail — Full Prompt Persistence**: Complete conversation payloads (all messages, JSONB) stored in new `request_payloads` table with prompt hash for integrity, capped at 256KB per request.
- **Audit Trail — Tool Invocation Logging**: All tool calls (function name, call ID, arguments) captured in `tool_invocations` table for both streaming and non-streaming paths.
- **Audit Trail — Failover History**: Failed credential attempts (429/401/403/5xx) recorded as JSONB `attempts` column on `request_logs`; `routing_decisions.actual_cost` backfilled after successful execution.
- **Provider Health Scoring**: Real-time composite health score (0.0–1.0) per provider computed from last 24h success rate + latency, cached 30s, integrated into Smart Router scoring with health_penalty trace notes.
- **Idempotency Key Support**: `Idempotency-Key` header on `/v1/chat/completions` enables 24h response replay for non-streaming requests and concurrency dedup via Redis locks.
- **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Hourly spend anomaly detection via z-score analysis with SSE alerts and REST endpoint.
- **Budget Threshold Alerts**: Automatic alert creation when budget usage crosses warning/critical/exceeded thresholds with daily dedup.

### Fixed
- **Stream Interruption Handling**: Mid-stream provider drops now emit graceful error event instead of abrupt disconnect.
- **Actual Cost Backfill**: `routing_decisions.actual_cost` field now correctly records post-execution cost instead of always being 0.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- **Routing Simulation & Interactive Playground (Pillar 4)**: New `/playground` page with full routing simulation — enter a prompt, select policy and budget status, and see the complete Smart Router classification, candidate scoring breakdown, and model selection without executing a real request.
- **Behind-the-Scenes Pipeline Visualizer**: Step-by-step flow diagram in the Playground showing Request → Classification → Candidate Filtering → Weighted Scoring → Budget Downgrade → Final Model Selection.
- **Quick Prompt Presets**: One-click prompt templates for coding, reasoning, creative, and fast Q&A tasks to quickly test routing behavior.
- **FinOps Cost Recommendations Engine (Pillar 5)**: `GET /api/analytics/finops` endpoint computing daily spend velocity, projected monthly cost, budget exhaustion forecast, and model substitution savings recommendations.
- **Dynamic Latency Feedback Loop (Pillar 6)**: Redis-backed 15-minute rolling window storing last 50 latency samples per model (TTFT + total latency), feeding dynamic speed scoring penalties (TTFT > 1000ms) and bonuses (TTFT < 400ms) into the Smart Router candidate scorer.
- **Circuit Breaker & 50x Server Outage Quarantine**: Automatic credential quarantine after 3 consecutive 50x errors with 60-second cooldown, preventing repeated routing to failing upstream servers. Status exposed via SSE as `CREDENTIAL_QUARANTINED` event.
- **Provider Abstraction Layer**: Unified `ProviderAdapter` interface with dedicated adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI Responses, and a meta-adapter for OpenCode that auto-detects sub-adapter by model prefix.
- **Web Sandbox Chat Interface**: `/sandbox` page providing an in-browser chat UI for testing Gateway API keys directly, with model selection and real-time streaming.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate `/analytics/logs` Route Registration**: Removed duplicate route causing Gin startup panic.
- **Analytics Response Unpacking**: Safely unpack `response.data` in `apiGetLogAnalytics` to prevent frontend crash on empty analytics data.
- **Strict Single Default Policy Enforcement**: Enforced `is_default` uniqueness across Create, Update, and SetDefault operations — only one routing policy can be active default at a time.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Global Gateway Keys Architecture (Hybrid Access Scope)**: Enabled default `provider_id = NULL` for Gateway API Keys, allowing a single API key to access all registered providers and the `prism-auto` Smart Router without provider isolation restrictions.
- **Logs Observability & Analytics Hub**: Added `GET /api/analytics/logs` backend endpoint and interactive analytics dashboard in `LogsPage()`.
- **Smart Router Savings Estimator**: Calculates estimated cost savings vs flagship model baseline (`cost_usd` saved).
- **Client App & Model SLA Breakdown**: Visual breakdown of spend, token volume, average TTFT (Time to First Token), and latency across client apps (OpenCode, Claude Code, Antigravity) and models.
- **1-Click CSV Log Export**: Export filtered log data directly to downloadable `.csv` spreadsheet files.
- **Roozy Auto Smart Router (`prism-auto`)**: Deterministic task classification (7 categories), request complexity heuristics, model capability registry scoring weights (Task, Quality, Cost, Speed), and weighted candidate scoring.
- **AI Budget Manager**: User-level monthly and daily expenditure limits, alert thresholds (`healthy`, `warning`, `critical`, `exceeded`), and automatic model downgrade logic before hard cutoffs.
- **Real-Time Cost Pipeline**: Automatic post-request calculation of `CostUSD` based on actual token usage and model pricing stored in `request_logs`.
- **Response Debugging Headers**: Injected `X-Prism-Model`, `X-Prism-Provider`, `X-Roozy-Model`, `X-Roozy-Provider`, and `X-Request-ID` headers in all HTTP responses.
- **Complete Error Audit Logging**: Record failed and error requests (status 429, 500, 502, 504) into `request_logs` with sanitized error messages.
- **Pre-Filtered Ready Pool**: Instant zero-delay rotater excluding credentials undergoing 429 cooldown in Redis.
- **UI Guardrails**: Disabled deletion of default policy (`balanced`) and added explicit modal warnings for budget deletion.
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/policies`, `/api/budgets`, `/api/routing/decisions`, `/api/analytics/logs`.

### Added
- **Smart Router Decision Details & Prompt Snippets**: Added migration `032_add_prompt_and_reasoning_to_routing_decisions.up.sql` (`prompt_preview` & `scores_breakdown` columns), extracted prompt preview snippets and scoring reasoning in `ResolveSemantic()`, and added `Details` action drawer in Next.js `LogsPage()` (`Smart Router Decisions` tab) to display request prompt text, candidate model scoring breakdown, and budget downgrade explanation.
- **Default Active Routing Policy Selection**: Added `is_default` column migration (`031_add_is_default_to_routing_policies.up.sql`), `SetDefault()` repository & handler endpoints (`PUT /policies/:id/default`), and `Set Active` action button in Next.js `PoliciesPage()` so users can switch which policy (`balanced`, `cheap`, `quality`, or custom) `prism-auto` uses by default.

### Fixed
- **Routing Decision Logging**: Fixed `RequestID` logging bug in `logRoutingDecision()` (`engine.go`) where model slug `"prism-auto"` was recorded instead of actual UUID request ID, and updated `Candidates` list to record all evaluated candidate models instead of single winning model.
- **Streaming Sandbox Global Key Model Resolution**: Fixed model resolution logic in `SandboxPage()` so selecting a Global Gateway Key dynamically combines models across all active providers and includes `prism-auto` Smart Router in the Target Model Alias dropdown.
- **Automatic Credential Quota & Cooldown Reset**: Added `enrichCredentialQuota` backend logic and updated frontend `RateLimitQuotaBadge` so credentials automatically return to `Normal` (Active) status as soon as countdown timers / daily midnight reset finishes, eliminating manual API hit requirements.
- **VPS Deployment Error (`docker compose up -d --no-build`)**: Forced `--no-build` flag and added `docker system prune` in CI/CD workflows (`api-ci-cd.yml`, `app-ci-cd.yml`) to prevent VPS from building from source or failing due to containerd storage corruption.
- **React Audit Log Crash (Minified Error #31)**: Fixed primitive string serialization for NullString fields in routing decision logs.
- **`sqlrowserr` Linter Warning**: Added `rows.Err()` check after `rows.Next()` loop in `routing_decision.go`.
